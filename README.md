# cryptographic scheme app

CS406 project. A simple Flask app that allows users to encrypt/decrypt messages with select cryptographic schemes such as one-time pad, a few different block ciphers, and a non-hashed RSA. Each page has its own scheme and a short explanation - both beginner-friendly and more technical, if the user wanted to know more about how and why it works.
