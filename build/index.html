		<!--EXPLANATION OF WEBSITE BELOW.....-->

		<p>
			This website is a fun, easy way to encode and decode messages and learn
			a little more about basic cryptographic schemes used both in the past
			and today! With a 'key' (a password or phrase that both you and a
			friend can remember) and this site, you can send secret messages
			without fear of being overheard.
		</p>

		<p>
			Learn more about how your data is kept safe through the
			beginner-friendly explanations at the bottom of each scheme's page, or
			dive deeper into the mathematical reasoning behind how and why a scheme
			works with a more advanced discussion below that.
		</p>

		<p>Happy encoding!</p>
